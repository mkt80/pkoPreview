A large round of applause to coaches, who selflessly volunteer their time and talent to the paddlers of Pale Kai. This is an
enormous undertaking that often takes away from a coach’s own paddling time. While there are standards in technique that Pale
Kai adheres to, as in every sport, each coach has their own style of coaching. If you have any questions about your crew’s
training, please feel free to discuss it with your coach or with the Head Coach.

Coaches face the difficult decision of determining race crews. Understand that coaches struggle to find a balance of what will
provide successful racing results for Pale Kai (as a competitive club) as well as give as many paddlers as possible a chance to
compete. In many cases, it takes years for paddlers to find themselves at a competitive level. We encourage paddlers to not be
discouraged, but to continue the sport. Sometimes you’ll find that one extra season is a difference in making crew on race day.

## Scott Bixler
### Head Coach

<p>
Scott began competitive paddling nearly two decades ago with Pale Kai and has enjoyed being on the water with friends and teammates over the years.  The competitive aspect of paddling is what initially drew him in but then over the years the constant challenges the ocean presents have kept him coming back for more.  
</p>
<p>
Scott has a good understanding of where the club has been, where it is is, and is looking forward to helping advance the club in this next season.  Technique and endurance will be two of the several focal points while focusing on the men's racing program.  Scott looks forward to working with all level of paddlers to make their goals come to fruition in 2024!

## Tommy Perez
### Novice Coach
<img src="/assets/images/bio/TommyP_2024.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>
"I just love to paddle!  6 man outrigger canoe paddling is the ultimate team sport. It’s rare, but building a crew of dedicated, selfless individuals will leave you with friendships and memories that last forever. All you have to do is just love to paddle and it will love you back." - Tommy
</p>
<p>
Tommy's love for paddling began "in the womb" and was realized in 2012 after joining Ka Nia'a Outrigger Canoe Club in Santa Barbara. From there he gained the skill sets needed to help their team medal in numerous races.  In 2022 Tommy moved to SLO county and joined Pale Kai, immediately integrating with the club by helping amplify PKO's culture of creating a competitive and fun experience.
</P>
<p>
Wherever Tommy is, he is easy to find...just lookout for the guy on the water with the biggest smile!

<h3>Jon Hergert</h3>
<h4>Mens Coach</h4>
<img src="/assets/images/bio/jonh.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>Jon Hergert, aka Neon Jon, has been a waterman and around waves his entire life which has been a big help to his paddling.  Of course, the first 20 years or so, the "water" was of the irrigation canal variety back on the farm in Nebraska and the "waves" were of  the "amber waves of grain variety."  Shovels, paddles, they both have blade and shafts and they kinda work the same!  First actual contact with Pacific Ocean was when he joined Pale Kai in 2014 so apparently persistence, stubbornness, and effort can make up for a lack of talent and previous experiences.  It's either that or people think you must be good at it because you work so hard trying to do it. </p>
<p>Making up for lost time, Jon was the Equipment Manager in 2015, Club President in 2016, and has been the Men's coach 2017, 2018, and will continue to be the Men's coach for 2019. </p>
<p>Neon has raced in OC6 and OC1 all over the west coast and even in Hawaii.  His favorite races are the most helpful races and those are usually the ones that turned out to be the biggest train wrecks where life presents you the opportunity to learn an important lesson or lessons. Although we always strive for the perfect race, perfect performance, we learn best through our mistakes.  Paddling is only fun when you are learning something, when you stop learning, it's just a bunch of work. </p>
<p>Neon still working hard for the perfect race, perfect performance for himself and others but secretly hopes never to find it.</p>

<h3>Tamara Jones</h3>
<h4>Women's Coach</h4>
<img src="/assets/images/bio/tamara.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>
Tamara has been a part of the Pale Kai family for over 10 years.
She has served on the board in a variety of roles, including as a
coach and as club president. Learning about, and paddling 
in, every canoe position has offered her an opportunity to experience 
personal growth, outrigger training techniques, and our team culture 
during workouts, competitions, and community events.
</p>
<p>
Tamara has found adventure and athletic endeavor on the water all her 
life and believes her experience as a lifelong student of surfing has 
had a tremendous impact on her development as a paddler. Outrigger 
paddling has added texture and balance to her busy life as a wife, mom, 
and business owner. Her career as a personal fitness trainer for the 
last 15 years has been key to her drive to help people use their bodies 
safely and successfully. Her current strategic coaching business helps 
her find more effective tools to empower others towards emotional and 
physical evolution.
</p>
<p>
Tamara feels very excited each year when the paddling season arrives 
and she is dedicated to helping the PKO family develop its outrigger 
culture in a way that offers all of us intense athletic opportunities 
as well as a deep connection with each other and with our ocean 
environment. She believes that we can, through our commitment to our 
experiences on the water, offer each other a unique and intimate 
commune with our natural world and with our paddling family.

<p>Bonnie came to paddling after an extensive competitive aquatic/water background which included lifeguarding, sailboat racing, swimming (age group and college &ndash; UCLA), and waterpolo.</p>
<p>After trying her hand at various adult recreational league sports including tennis, soccer and beach volleyball while raising her 3 kids, Bonnie heard about a local outrigger team that was starting practices and decided to go and check it out.&nbsp; One practice and she was hooked.&nbsp; Bonnie has been paddling since 2008. She has had many opportunities to race since then including all of the SCORA races and the Catalina Crossing.&nbsp; She also has competed in many Northern California races including Monterey, Santa Cruz, Alcatrez, Angel Island, Tahoe (both north and south) and Monterey Crossing where she was part of a record breaking open coed team that included 3 other Pale Kai members. She has also had opportunities to race outside of California in Arizona (ADR), the Columbia River Gorge and Hawaii (Queen Liliuokalani, Pailolo Challenge, Na Wahine O Ke Kai and the Na Pali Challenge- where her team was 1<sup>st</sup> in the over 55 category).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonnie shared her love of the sport with her husband, Patrick, who joined the team after seeing how passionate she was about the sport.&nbsp; They have enjoyed training, traveling and racing together over the past 10 years. &nbsp;Bonnie feels that paddling is a sport that not only challenges you physically with an incredible workout but is also good for your soul- &ldquo;time on the water brings a renewal to your mind and body and I would like to encourage everyone to come and try it out&rdquo;.</p>

## Austin Bixler
### Men's Coach
<img src="/assets/images/bio/AustinB_2023.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>
Austin's passion for paddling began in 2009. Paddling and racing in every seat has offered a unique perspective on the challenges presented in every seat as well as what makes a boat run fast. Almost exclusively steering for the past 2 years has provoked a greater understanding of what it takes to win and how to mentor a crew into being the best they can collectively be. Boasting a top 10 overall finish last year in a SCORA Iron race is just the tip of the iceberg. The focus for this year’s Men’s team will consist of: individual duties with collective, synchronized response. That combined with surf, endurance, steering, and efficiency training will make us a force to be reckoned with.

## Andrew Wilkening
### Novice Coach
<img src="/assets/images/bio/AndrewW_2022.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>
Andrew discovered outrigger paddling in Maui when he joined his high school's varsity crew. In this first year of paddling, and under the incredible coaching of Paul Lu'uvai, Andrew quickly became a leader in both fitness and technique. His team won the MIL Championship and earned 3rd in the State finals.
</p>
<p>
A decade later, Andrew found a second family - Pale Kai. Although his first year was filled with bumps and trials, just like the waters of the Central Coast, his dedication and love for the canoe kept Andrew on this path that continues to impact his body, mind and life for the better. Andrew continues to paddle all over California with the support of Pale Kai's aloha spirit.

## Bob Teaford
### Novice Coach
<img src="/assets/images/bio/BobT_2023.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>
Bob joined Pale Kai in 2019 as a Novice, paddled through the 'COVID years,' and raced as a veteran in 2022. His background in sport includes road bike racing, mountain bike racing, car racing, as well as lots of sailboat racing and cruising, more than 10,000 miles all around the world. He joined Pale Kai in pretty poor health and, after four years of paddling, claims his fitness is as good or better than in his 20's. Bob's hope as a Novice coach is to provide a safe, supportive, and encouraging environment for everyone to reach that elusive combination of great fitness, deep sense of well being, and development of new friendships, all the while working together as a team toward the common goal of paddling faster than all the other novice teams!
