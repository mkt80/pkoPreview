<p>Complete the following steps to sign up for a great year of paddling with Pale Kai Outrigger!</p>

<h4>#1: Create (or Update) your SCORA Account</h4>
<P>Go to <a  href="https://www.scora.org/login/" target="_blank">https://www.scora.org/login/</a>. New paddlers
will need to create a SCORA account. Make a note of your SCORA ID. Once your SCORA registration is complete, you will be sent to
Smartwaiver to sign your waiver. </p>

<p>Returning paddlers need only sign the Smartwaiver.</P>

<p>You will be emailed a link to your completed Smartwaiver. Download and SAVE IT! You'll need it for the next step. (Be aware that
the link is only good for three days, so don't hesitate.) </p>
