<p>Complete the following steps to sign up for a great year of paddling with Pale Kai Outrigger!</p>

<h4>#1: Create (or Update) your SCORA Account</h4>
<p>New Paddlers: Create your SCORA account at
<a href="https://www.scoraregistration.com/paddler_register" target="_blank">www.scoraregistration.com/paddler_register</a>.
Make a note of your SCORA ID. Once registration is complete, you will be sent to SmartWaiver to sign your waiver.
</p>

<p>Returning Paddlers: Log into your SCORA account at
<a href="https://www.scoraregistration.com/paddler_login" target="_blank">www.scoraregistration.com/paddler_login</a>.

back to the registration site to update your account information.
</p>
<p><i>You can complete your registration without uploading your SmartWaiver. HOWEVER, it is required before getting in a boat.</i></p>
