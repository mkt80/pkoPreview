<p>Complete the following steps to sign up for a great year of paddling with Pale Kai Outrigger!</p>

<h4>#1: Create (or Update) your SCORA Account</h4>
<P>Go to <a  href="https://www.scora.org/login/" target="_blank">https://www.scora.org/login/</a>. New paddlers
will need to create a SCORA account. Make a note of your SCORA ID. Once your SCORA registration is complete, you will be sent to
Smartwaiver to sign your waiver. </p>

<p>Returning paddlers need only sign the Smartwaiver.</P>

<p>You will be emailed a link to your completed Smartwaiver. Download and SAVE IT! You'll need it for the next step. (Be aware that
the link is only good for three days, so don't hesitate.) </p>

<h4>#2: Annual PKO Member Registration</h4>

February 1st. Sign up for the newsletter, below, to be informed when regisration opens up.</p> 

<p>PKO uses TeamSnap to manage our membership roster, collect dues, schedule workouts, races, and other events, and to 
communicate with members. When you tap the button below, you'll be taken to TeamSnap where you can register for the
current year.</p>

<p>Complete your annual PKO member registration. In one swoop, youâ€™ll accomplish the following:</p>
<ol>

	<li>Upload your <b>completed SCORA Smartwaiver</b></li>
	<li>Initial the PKO Safety and Code of Conduct Policies</li>
	<li>Select your payment method for dues - online or offline. </li>
