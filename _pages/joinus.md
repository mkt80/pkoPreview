<h2>What to Bring</h2>
<p>
    <b>Outrigger paddling is a water sport and the water on the central coast is cold year round!</b>
    The air may be chilly but you will warm up once we start paddling.
    We recommend dressing in warm, water-wicking layers. Synthetic and wool fabrics are preferred while on the water 
    as these will keep you warm
    even if they get wet. Cotton is fine before and after paddling, but should be avoided while paddling.
</p>

<h3>Suggested Attire</h3>
<ul>
<li>A synthetic water-wicking shirt or rashguard topped by a light- or mid-weight windbreaker.</li>
<li>Neoprene pants, board shorts, or synthetic leggings.</li>
<li>Water socks or surf booties.</li>
<li>A hat for warmth and/or sun protection.</li>
<li>Sunglasses.</li>
<li>Dry clothes for after your paddle.</li>
<li>A sweatshirt or jacket to keep warm before and after your paddle.</li>
<li>Also bring sunscreen and water to keep hydrated before, during, and after your paddle.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>
    Note that all paddlers will be provided with a PFD (life preserver) which must be worn at all times until they have
    completed a brief swim test.
</i></p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>
A Pale Kai coach will provide brief instructions on paddling technique, roles and responsibilities of the various positions in the
canoe, and basic safety information. We will then go for a paddle around beautiful Morro Bay followed by a Q&A with
Pale Kai members.
</p>

<h2>Novice Year Participation</h2>

<h2>Novice Year Overview</h2>

<h4>January - February:  Recruitment </h4>


<p>
    <!-- Temporarilty this copy to avoid confusion AFTER recruiting season
    Pale Kai’s “Three for Free” policy
    allows newcomers to experience outrigger paddling in the relatively calm waters of Morro Bay without paying a fee or membership
    dues.
    -->
    The recruitment season is the time to become acquainted with the sport and culture of outrigger canoe racing while making new
    friends!
</p>

<h4>March - April:  Race Training 3 times a week</h4>
<p>Race training will begin in early March.</p>
<p>
Your novice coach will provide the skills training you will need for the upcoming race season. It is important to practice with your team consistently to develop your technique and timing. You will also form new friendships (for no additional fee!).</p>

<p>All paddlers must be proficient swimmers. Before our competitive season begins, you must pass a water safety test that includes
huli drills (recovering from an overturned canoe), treading water, as well as a 100 meter swim test administered by a PKO coach.</p>

<h4>May-June: Iron Race Season (6 person crews)</h4>
<p>
The first official races begin in May.  Pale Kai is a member of the Southern California Outrigger Racing Association (SCORA).  We compete with other member clubs in SCORA, and our official events take place between San Diego and Santa Barbara. The first five races take place from early May through the end of June or early-July.  In the novice division, races are approximately 4 to 5 miles and occur in more protected waters than the veteran divisions.   Iron races consist of 6 person crews over a set distance, and novice teams may race under men’s, women’s, or co-ed divisions.
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scora.org/races/" target="_blank" class="button">View SCORA Race Schedule</a></p>

<p>The Iron Season concludes with the championships in San Diego. This highly attended event attracts entrants from all over the state and is a fitting tribute to the outrigger culture. For added fun, novice teams are encouraged to enter the Novice Dance Competition to display their grace and creativity, or just poke fun at themselves in a family friendly environment.
</p>
<h4>August-September: 9-Man Season</h4>
<p>
9-person races involve crews of up to 9 paddlers. While 6 paddlers paddle the canoe, the remaining paddlers take a break on a 
chase boat and periodically relieve the paddlers. 9-person races are generally much longer than iron races, ranging from
about 18 miles to over 30 miles.
</p>
<p>
Due to the increased physical demands and skills required to paddle 9-person distances and to perform open water
crew changes, there is no guarantee that a first-year paddler will be invited to participate in a 9-person race crew. That
said, first-year paddlers who demonstrate sufficient conditioning and proficiency <b>may</b> invited to compete in the 9-person
season. And, of course, all members are welcome to practice year round.
</p>

<p>
    The race season finishes with the US Outrigger Championships Catalina Crossing where women's and co-ed teams race from Newport to Catalina
    on Saturday and the men race back on Sunday. 
    <!--Here's the drone footage of the women and coed crews leaving Newport.-->

-->

<h4>September-March:  Winter Paddling</h4>
<p>Winter practices will be subject to daylight and weather restrictions and continue at Avila Beach, until the time changes.
A few canoes will  then be re-located to Morro Bay for more protected paddling.  
</p>
<p>By the time your novice season is over, you will have gained some new skills, increased your fitness levels and made a number of new friends.
</p>

<h4>Next Level: The World Stage</h4>

<p>Outrigger canoe racing takes place all over the world! The Olamau Race sees the best outrigger canoe teams compete off the coast of Hawaii’s Big Island. Ocean knowledge, skill, and perseverance aren’t always enough to succeed, but they can keep you above water. Watch the short below about a Californian team competing in The Olamau Race.</p>
