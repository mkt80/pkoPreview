<h2>Practice Schedule</h2>
<P>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, 2021 practices are currently limited to veteran and alumni paddlers. Workouts are as follows:
<!--
<p>For this season, Pale Kai Outrigger women's and men's teams will practice 3 days a week with a fourth day of practice for those who wish to race on top teams. It's going to be great year with more blending amongst all our paddlers and lots more time on the water.</p>
