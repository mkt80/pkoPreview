<p>Even if your racing days are over, we would like to encourage our long lost ohana to return to the ocean sport they love. Alumni are invited to participate in regular Monday and Saturday practices throughout the season, and in offseason paddling. </p>

<p>Alumni yearly dues are $200 and cover all your workouts from March 1st thru the following February.</p>

<p>For further questions about our Alumni Program, reach out to our membership director, Jeff. To sign up for this year's Alumni Program head on over to our <a href="http://www.palekai.org/members/registration/">Member Registration Page</a>.</p>
