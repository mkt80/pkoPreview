<p>Even if your racing days are over, we would like to encourage our long lost ohana to return to the ocean sport they love.</p>

<p>For 2023, we're trying something new... Alumni are invited to share their love and knowledge of the sport with our Novices
by participating in weekday (evening) Novice practices. Go to the <a href="/open-program/">Racing Program Page</a> for the current schedule. (Note that Novices will practice in Morro Bay until early- or mid-April.)</p>

<p>Alumni dues are $200 and cover all your workouts from March 1st thru the following February.</p>

<p>To sign up for this year's Alumni Program head on over to our <a href="http://www.palekai.org/members/registration/">Member Registration Page</a>.</p>

<p>For further questions about our Alumni Program, reach out to our membership director, Jeff.
