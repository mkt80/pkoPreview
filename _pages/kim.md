<b>Aloha O'hana.</b> On July 16th, 2023, Pale Kai and the entire paddling community lost a beloved member of our ohana. Pale Kai Outrigger Canoe Club
and Kai Wai Northbay Paddling Club will host a Memorial Paddle-Out, Celebration of Life, and Beach BBQ lunch in loving memory of Kim on August 5th, 2023.

<p>Please join us as we gather to celebrate her beautiful life on the water. We will paddle out together for a short distance,
have a blessing, and spread Kim's ashes in the sea, a place she truly loved to be.</p>

<p>The paddle-out will be followed by a casual Hawaiian-style lunch right on the beach in Avila. Plan to stay after the paddle-out and
lunch as we continue to celebrate her life.</p>
