On Saturday, April 13th, Pale Kai will hold it's Annual Launch Party in Avila Beach. Expect a safety briefing and a combined (Vets, Novices), if
abbreviated, workout, followed by a BBQ on the beach. All members are encouraged to participate. Let's see how many canoes we can get on the water at
once!
