On Saturday, September 23rd, Pale Kai Outrigger celebrated the end of our race season with our Second Annual Pale Kai "Fun Run" - An
informal opportunity for Pale Kai, select guest clubs and paddlers, and their families to join us for a paddle, raffle, auction, and
luau.
 
We especially want to thank our sponsors who so generously donated to our raffle and auction:
