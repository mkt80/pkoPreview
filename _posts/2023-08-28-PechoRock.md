On Saturday, September 23rd, Pale Kai Outrigger and the Avila Beach Tourism Alliance will celebrate the end of our race season
with an Outrigger Canoe Exhibition - An
opportunity for Pale Kai, members of select guest clubs, and experienced paddlers, to join us for an informal paddle. The paddle
will be followed by a raffle, silent auction, and luau on the beautiful Central Coast.
<p>
For Pale Kai, this is not only a time to celebrate with our friends, families, and peer clubs, it's also our primary fundraiser.
This year, we plan to donate a portion of our proceeds to aid victims of the fires in Maui.
<P>
Note that, while the this event is open to the public, for liability reasons, only experienced paddlers will be allowed on the water and
the plate lunch is restricted to paddlers and their families. The public is invited to observe the events, participate in the raffle and auction, and generally mingle with the paddlers.
<p>
If you're an experienced paddler and you plan to paddle with us, please <a href="https://forms.gle/BHFC5sqZcf2nMhag9" target="_blank" class="button special">RSVP</a> by September 20th.
