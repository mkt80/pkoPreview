On Saturday, September 23rd, Pale Kai Outrigger and the Avila Beach Tourism Alliance will celebrate the end of our race season
with an Outrigger Canoe Exhibition - An
opportunity for Pale Kai, select guest clubs and paddlers, and their families to join us for an informal paddle, raffle, silent auction, and
luau on the beautiful Central Coast.
<p>
For Pale Kai, this is not only a time to celebrate with our friends, families, and peer clubs, it's also our primary fundraiser.
This year, we plan to donate a portion of our proceeds to aid victims of the fires in Maui.
<P>
Note that, while the this event is open to the public, for liability reasons, only invited guests and their families will be allowed to paddle or to participate
in the plate lunch. The public is invited to observe the events, participate in the raffle and auction, and generally mingle with the paddlers.
