# Pale Kai Outrigger Website

This repository contains the files used for generating the Pale Kai Outrigger website. ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶) ᕗ https://www.palekai.org/ 

The site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), where the site is hosted, natively supports Jekyll so every time someone pushes to this repository, the website will be built and updated. For hosting it yourself, see Setting up a local copy of the website.

# Setting up local development
```sh
bundle install
jekyll server ( to view locally )
jekyll build ( to compile production )
```

# How to Use

See this [marvelous guide by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to get you up and running. It will teach you what you need to know about Git, GitHub, and Jekyll to maintain and extend the Pale Kai Outrigger website.

Check out all the details about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).
