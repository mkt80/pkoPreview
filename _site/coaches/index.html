			<h1>Meet the Coaches</h1>
		</header>
		
		<p class="post-date"></p>

		<p><p>A large round of applause to coaches, who selflessly volunteer their time and talent to the paddlers of Pale Kai. This is an enormous undertaking that often takes away from a coach’s own paddling time. While there are standards in technique that Pale Kai adheres to, as in every sport, each coach has their own style of coaching. If you have any questions about your crew’s training, please feel free to discuss it with your coach or with the Head Coach.</p>

<p>Coaches face the difficult decision each race day of determining which six paddlers will be selected to participate in the race. Understand that coaches struggle to find a balance of what will provide successful racing results for Pale Kai (as a competitive club) as well as give as many paddlers as possible a chance to compete in a race. In many cases, it takes years for paddlers to find themselves at a competitive level. We encourage paddlers to not be discouraged, but to continue the sport. Sometimes you’ll find that one extra season is a difference in making crew on race day.</p>

<h2 id="john-savarese">John Savarese</h2>
<h3 id="head-coach--mens-coach">Head Coach &amp; Men’s Coach</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bio/johns.jpg" class="headshot" /></p>
<p>John has lived in California his whole life. Born and raised in Southern California, John spent most of his free time growing up surfing, water skiing, sailing and jet sking. After a long career in public safety, John moved to the central coast where he discovered outrigger canoe and he has been hooked ever since. John has participated in a variety of OC1 and OC6 races including Iron, Nine Man, Catalina Crossing, Alcatraz, Columbia River Gorge, and Pailolo Challenge.</p>
<p>John prides himself on providing a fun, safe, and challenging atmosphere where hard work is rewarded and achievement is celebrated.  He strives every day to inspire and motivate his team to excellence in Outrigger canoe. John Believes that individually we are merely one drop, but together, we are an ocean. John continues to foster the positive spirit of outrigger canoe that attracted him to the sport several years ago and feels honored to be coaching Pale Kai.</p>

<h3>Jon Hergert</h3>
<h4>Mens Coach</h4>
<img src="/assets/images/bio/jonh.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>Jon Hergert, aka Neon Jon, has been a waterman and around waves his entire life which has been a big help to his paddling.  Of course, the first 20 years or so, the "water" was of the irrigation canal variety back on the farm in Nebraska and the "waves" were of  the "amber waves of grain variety."  Shovels, paddles, they both have blade and shafts and they kinda work the same!  First actual contact with Pacific Ocean was when he joined Pale Kai in 2014 so apparently persistence, stubbornness, and effort can make up for a lack of talent and previous experiences.  It's either that or people think you must be good at it because you work so hard trying to do it. </p>
<p>Making up for lost time, Jon was the Equipment Manager in 2015, Club President in 2016, and has been the Men's coach 2017, 2018, and will continue to be the Men's coach for 2019. </p>
<p>Neon has raced in OC6 and OC1 all over the west coast and even in Hawaii.  His favorite races are the most helpful races and those are usually the ones that turned out to be the biggest train wrecks where life presents you the opportunity to learn an important lesson or lessons. Although we always strive for the perfect race, perfect performance, we learn best through our mistakes.  Paddling is only fun when you are learning something, when you stop learning, it's just a bunch of work. </p>
<p>Neon still working hard for the perfect race, perfect performance for himself and others but secretly hopes never to find it.</p>

<h3>Bonnie Lyons</h3>
<h4>Womens Coach</h4>
<img src="/assets/images/bio/bonni.jpg"  class="headshot" />
<p>Bonnie came to paddling after an extensive competitive aquatic/water background which included lifeguarding, sailboat racing, swimming (age group and college &ndash; UCLA), and waterpolo.</p>
<p>After trying her hand at various adult recreational league sports including tennis, soccer and beach volleyball while raising her 3 kids, Bonnie heard about a local outrigger team that was starting practices and decided to go and check it out.&nbsp; One practice and she was hooked.&nbsp; Bonnie has been paddling since 2008. She has had many opportunities to race since then including all of the SCORA races and the Catalina Crossing.&nbsp; She also has competed in many Northern California races including Monterey, Santa Cruz, Alcatrez, Angel Island, Tahoe (both north and south) and Monterey Crossing where she was part of a record breaking open coed team that included 3 other Pale Kai members. She has also had opportunities to race outside of California in Arizona (ADR), the Columbia River Gorge and Hawaii (Queen Liliuokalani, Pailolo Challenge, Na Wahine O Ke Kai and the Na Pali Challenge- where her team was 1<sup>st</sup> in the over 55 category).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonnie shared her love of the sport with her husband Patrick ( a former Pale Kai coach) who joined the team after seeing how passionate she was about the sport.&nbsp; They have enjoyed training, traveling and racing together over the past 10 years. &nbsp;Bonnie feels that paddling is a sport that not only challenges you physically with an incredible workout but is also good for your soul- &ldquo;time on the water brings a renewal to your mind and body and I would like to encourage everyone to come and try it out&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Tamara Jones</h3>
<h4>Women's Coach</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bio/tamara.jpg" class="headshot" /></p>
<p>
Tamara has been a part of the Pale Kai family for over 10 years.
She has served on the board in a variety of roles, including as a
coach and as club president. Learning about, and paddling 
in, every canoe position has offered her an opportunity to experience 
personal growth, outrigger training techniques, and our team culture 
during workouts, competitions, and community events.
</p>
<p>
Tamara has found adventure and athletic endeavor on the water all her 
life and believes her experience as a lifelong student of surfing has 
had a tremendous impact on her development as a paddler. Outrigger 
paddling has added texture and balance to her busy life as a wife, mom, 
and business owner. Her career as a personal fitness trainer for the 
last 15 years has been key to her drive to help people use their bodies 
safely and successfully. Her current strategic coaching business helps 
her find more effective tools to empower others towards emotional and 
physical evolution.
</p>
<p>
Tamara feels very excited each year when the paddling season arrives 
and she is dedicated to helping the PKO family develop its outrigger 
culture in a way that offers all of us intense athletic opportunities 
as well as a deep connection with each other and with our ocean 
environment. She believes that we can, through our commitment to our 
experiences on the water, offer each other a unique and intimate 
commune with our natural world and with our paddling family.
